  <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>LSE Dance Club, as the winner of the Gold STARS award, strives in every way to provide a platform for dancers in LSE to maximise their potential and to be a part of an amazing family.
    Our teachers are all professional, experienced and they will inspire and push you. We have a variety of genres that you can choose from and we also offer beginners classes for those who do not have a dance background! There are also opportunities for all members to choreograph and teach classes.
    We embrace the values of self-motivation, versatility, diversity, creativity and inclusivity. If any of these values resonate with you, the Dance Club is the perfect environment for you to either learn something new, hone your craft further or even pick up from where you left off!
